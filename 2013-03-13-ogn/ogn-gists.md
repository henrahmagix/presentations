# Gists by GitHub


## What is GitHub?

Online code hosting that gives you public and private Git repositories.

- Public repos are unlimited!
- Private repos cost

## What are Gists?

Gists are Git repos, same as any other.

However, on GitHub:

- No pull-requests
- But you can fork them
- And clone, update, and push revisions



## Got some code? Want to share it?

There are loads of code sharing sites

+ [Pastebin][]
+ [Pastie][]
+ [Friendpaste][]
+ [Ideone][]
+ [Instacode][]

Some compile, some allow edits

Some even give you hipstery-angle, faux tilt-shift, vignette renders of code



# Instacod.es

### ![bagger instacode][]



# But they don't give you a Git repository

No siree.



## Gists are free!

Secret Gists are free and unlimited

### WOOT!

Only limit is GitHub functionality:

- No code review
- No issue tracking
- Still no pull-requests



# Using Gists for more... what?



# Writing



## [Gist.Io][]

### ![gist io image][]



# Live Demos



## [bl.ocks.org][]

View any public Gist with an `index.html` file as a served web page

Reference local files in the repository, so you can:

- Add Javascript to demo some code
- Add CSS to prototype a design
- Send the link to a client


## Happy client?
