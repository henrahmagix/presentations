# Henry's Presentations

A collection of my talks. Each talk is a public gist, added as a submodule.

To view a talk, click the __View__ link, which [uses the _wonderful_ Gist.io][Gist.io].

To present a talk, [use the _brilliant_ Gistdeck][Gistdeck].



### [Nice Front End Things][nice things] - [View][nice things view]

## Gistdeck issues

The issues Gistdeck currently has with [gist.github.com][] are fixed in my fork. Unfortunately, I cannot serve via `https` from [GitHub Pages][] (required by the gists page) so I am using `https://raw.github.com/user/repo/file`, which serves as the incorrect mime-type of `text/plain`. I will update when [nzoschke][] accepts [my](https://github.com/nzoschke/gistdeck/pull/15) [pull-requests](https://github.com/nzoschke/gistdeck/pull/16) and [Gistdeck][] is working again.



## What about post-talk edits?

Most of my presentations are edited after they have been given. As such, every presentation will have a git tag of `presented` to which you can checkout:

    git checkout presented

Version tags (`v1.1`) keep track of edits.
