# Henry's Presentations

A collection of my talks. Each talk is a public gist, collated here via submodules.

## Cloning Gists

[gist.github.com](http://gist.github.com) now gives `git clone` urls as `https` rather than `ssh`. This will require entering your GitHub username and password _every time you push_.

Here is the __ssh__ url for a gist:

`git@gist.github.com:GIST_ID.git`

For example, my [JSOxford](http://twitter.com/jsoxford) talk from 17th Jan 2013:

`git@gist.github.com:4557586.git`
