# Henry's Presentations

A collection of my talks. Each talk is a public gist, added as a submodule.

To view a talk, click the __Slides__ link, which [uses the _wonderful_ Gist.io][Gist.io].

To present a talk, [use the _brilliant_ Gistdeck][Gistdeck].

Audio is available for some slides.

## How do I build my slides?

I write in Markdown using Sublime Text 2, preview in a browser that creates interactive slides, then save as a static HTML page to work in any browser. It's an incredibly quick process using open-source tech, so I urge you to [check out the steps here][build slides steps].



## Gistdeck issues

Gistdeck is currently working! However, if it breaks for you in any way, please [submit an issue to the repository][Gistdeck issues].



## What about post-talk edits?

Most of my presentations are edited after they have been given. As such, every presentation will have a git tag of `presented` to which you can checkout:

    git checkout presented

Version tags (`v1.1`, etc) keep track of edits.
